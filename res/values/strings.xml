All points you earn will be multiplied by this amount.\nShooting the left ramp will also advance the multiplier.\n- The game starts with ball savers in the left and right outlanes, which disappear when used. Hit all drop targets on the left or right side to restore them.\n- Hitting any group of drop targets will activate the next light in the center of the field. When the large white central light is activated, shoot the left ramp for an extra ball.\n\nVector Pinball is open source; the code is at https://github.com/dozingcat/Vector-Pinball</string>
